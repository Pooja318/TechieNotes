            There have been times when I have started learning different technologies. And I have the habit to creating notes while learning. 
        But all the points jotted down are present in different notes pads or dairies. 
        And when I go for interview and have to go through all the topics, I am always struggling finding my notes.
        So here is my website with all the notes I have created, so that I can have an easy navigation to my Techie Notes!
        <br />
            <br />
            Have fun exploring my notes. And feel free to correct me in any topic if you find any mistake.
        <br />
            <br />
            FYI: The websites design and everything is done from the scratch my me, so that I can implement my learning practically.
